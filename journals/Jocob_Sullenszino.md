Today, I worked on:

* Connecting PgAdmin with the therapy and account systems, and creating a new endpoint for posts.

Today, I worked on:

.
As a team, we created our first post endpoint and verified it was correctly stored in the Pg database. We also completed our first merge and pull, but encountered some errors in the pipeline. To address this, we decided to comment out part of the GitLab-CI and ran some flake8 tests to ensure the formatting was correct.

In addition, we created the issues in GitLab and plan to assign points tomorrow.
